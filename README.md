### About Me :

Hey there! My name is Aziz, a passionate Designer who's now embarking on an amazing journey to become a Software Engineer with UI/UX design skills ðŸš€ðŸŒŸðŸŽ† I am passionate about design and the world of software development.

Currently, I am:

- A student immersed in the world of software development, and learning various programming languages and tools.
- Exploring front-end and back-end development to gain a holistic understanding of software development and the inner working of seamless, interactive digital experiences.
- Tackling new challenges, solving complex problems, and continuously growing as a software engineer as I bring my unique design perspective into the world of development.
- Applying my design expertise, and honing my UI/UX skills to craft intuitive UI and engaging UX that merge aesthetics with functionality.
- Looking for interesting and impactful work/projects (please don't be shy to reach out!).


>_"My goal is to comprehensively address all facets of the end-user experience within the system, encompassing visual design, interface functionality, physical interactions, and overall usability."_
